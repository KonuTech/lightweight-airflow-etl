"""``detect_header`` -- CSV-07/CSV-08's header/metadata-preamble/footer detector.

For each candidate row index, score it on (a) all fields non-empty, (b) all
fields non-numeric, (c) field count equal to the modal field count of the
following rows -- STACK.md's own ``detector/header.py`` design (see
06-06-PLAN.md's ``<objective>``). The first row clearing every applicable
gate is the header; everything before it is a metadata preamble
(``12_metadata_before_header.csv``). A row shaped exactly like the data
below it (``11_no_header.csv``) clears no row at all, so ``has_header`` is
``False`` and column names must come from the contract instead.

Value uniqueness -- STACK.md §11's fourth signal -- is deliberately not a
gate here: fixtures ``14_duplicate_columns.csv``/
``48_duplicate_header_names_case_variant.csv`` need a row *with* duplicate
values to still be recognised as the header, so the duplicate-name
rejection below has something to reject. A row that failed detection
outright would never reach that check.

Once a header is known, two more things are detected against the rows that
follow it: trailing footer rows (a differing field count, or a match
against a contract-supplied regex -- fixtures ``13_footer.csv``,
``64_footer_totals_with_different_column_count.csv``), and an interior row
that exactly repeats the header's own values, e.g. a concatenated export
(fixture ``63_repeated_header_mid_file.csv``). Both are recorded on
``HeaderDetection`` rather than silently dropped from ``rows`` --
excluding them from the loaded record set is a later wiring plan's job
(the streaming reader named in this plan's own ``<objective>``); this
module only detects.

Exact and case-variant duplicate header names both raise
``dataplat.errors.FileInspectionError`` unconditionally. Corpus fixture
48's own declared outcome is ``rejected-file`` regardless of
``CsvParsingConfig.header_case_sensitive``'s value, because PostgreSQL
folds unquoted identifiers to lower case: a case-insensitive collision is
real structural damage no matter how header-to-contract name matching is
configured elsewhere. ``header_case_sensitive`` therefore governs a
different, later concern (header-to-``columns:``-contract matching) and is
deliberately not a parameter of this function.

Input contract (T-06-27, this plan's own threat register): ``rows`` is a
bounded prefix of the file's physical rows, already split by the dialect
detector's delimiter -- enough rows to see the modal field count reliably
(a caller passing, say, the first ~20 rows is enough for every corpus
fixture this module is tested against), never the full streamed file.
Bounding it is the caller's responsibility, not this function's.

            whitespace stripped, when ``header_trim=True`` was requested.
