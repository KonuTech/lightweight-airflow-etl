r"""Filename mask compiler/matcher — CSV-01's token-to-regex engine (D-07/D-08/D-09/D-11).

Mask syntax is strptime-style named tokens (D-07), e.g.
``{dataset}_{country}_{business_date:%Y%m%d}[_{seq:03d}].csv`` — not raw
regex, not a token+regex-escape-hatch hybrid. Individual facets can be
marked optional within one mask using bracket syntax (D-08), e.g.
``[_{seq:03d}]``. A filename that does not match its dataset's configured
mask at all is rejected with a named diagnostic (D-09) — never processed
with the unmatched facets left null.

Implements 06-RESEARCH.md's Architecture Patterns Pattern 3 two-pass
*re-parse* design (a compiled regex extracts substrings, then ``strptime``
re-parses date-typed ones using the SAME format string the regex character
class was built from — the format-to-regex mapping and the
format-to-strptime mapping are never two independently-maintained tables),
combined with a single left-to-right *scan* over the mask text itself:
``compile_mask`` walks the mask exactly once via one combined regex
(``_SCAN_RE``) that alternates between "a token", "a bracket", and "a run
of literal characters", rather than chaining two independent ``re.sub``
passes over the whole mask. A chained-``re.sub`` design was tried and
rejected during this plan's own implementation: expanding bracket-optional
segments first (e.g. ``[_{seq:03d}]`` -> ``(?:_(?P<seq>\\d{3}))?``) and then
running a second, unscoped token substitution over the *entire* resulting
string re-matches the just-generated ``{3}`` quantifier as if it were an
unexpanded ``{name}`` token, corrupting the pattern (verified live: raises
``re.error: bad character in group name '03'``). A single pass has no such
self-interference. Literal mask text (delimiters like ``_``, the ``.csv``
suffix) is ``re.escape``-d as it is scanned, so a mask's own regex
metacharacters (a literal ``.`` in ``.csv`` is the concrete case in every
example mask this phase uses) can never accidentally widen what the
compiled pattern matches.

``parse`` (PyPI) was evaluated and rejected (06-RESEARCH.md Pattern 3): it
supports strptime tokens but has no concept of D-08's bracket-optional
segments, so adopting it would still require hand-writing the optional-
segment layer this module provides anyway.

The compiled regex is whole-string-anchored (``^...$``) per the Claude's
Discretion recommendation 06-RESEARCH.md's Pattern 3 makes explicitly: a
prefix match would silently accept a truncated or extra-suffix filename,
contradicting D-09's "fail with a named diagnostic" framing. Every
generated character class is fixed-width and bounded (``\\d{4}``, ``\\d{2}``,
a bounded ``[^_./]+`` free-form segment) — never ``.*`` or a nested/
backtracking quantifier, so an attacker-controlled filename cannot trigger
catastrophic regex backtracking regardless of length (T-06-03).
