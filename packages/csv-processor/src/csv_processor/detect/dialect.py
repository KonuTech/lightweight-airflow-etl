"""CSV-04/05/06 dialect detection: a ``clevercsv`` wrapper with the single-column guard.

``clevercsv.Detector().detect(sample)`` is the verified choice over both a
hand-rolled delimiter-frequency heuristic (fails fixture
``37_delimiter_frequency_differs_header_vs_body.csv``, where the header row's
own delimiter frequency disagrees with the body's) and stdlib ``csv.Sniffer``
(documented to raise ``_csv.Error: Could not determine delimiter`` on a
genuinely single-column file, and to misidentify delimiters that appear
inside quoted fields -- STACK.md Section F). ``sample`` here is always
already-decoded text: dialect detection runs strictly after the encoding
detector's output and strictly before numeric normalization (T-06-10's
mitigation -- a crafted file whose delimiter equals a decimal separator
cannot corrupt an amount column, because the delimiter is fixed before any
column is interpreted as a number).

**Pitfall 1** (06-RESEARCH.md Common Pitfalls Number 1, reproduced live
against fixture ``38_single_column_no_delimiter.csv``): ``Detector().detect()``
returns ``SimpleDialect('', '', '')`` -- not ``None``, not an exception -- for
a genuinely single-column sample. Calling ``.to_csv_dialect()`` on that result
raises ``_csv.Error: "delimiter" must be a 1-character string``, because
Python's ``csv`` module requires a real 1-character delimiter even when
nothing will ever match it. The guard is ``dialect.delimiter == ""``, checked
immediately after ``detect()`` returns, before ``.to_csv_dialect()`` is ever
called.

**A second, related gap found live in this plan (not documented anywhere in
06-RESEARCH.md), against fixture ``36_doubled_vs_backslash_escape.csv``:**
``Detector().detect()`` can also return ``None`` outright -- a third outcome
distinct from both a clean detection and Pitfall 1's degenerate
``SimpleDialect('', '', '')``. This happens when the consistency-measure
detector cannot converge on any candidate dialect with sufficient confidence.
Verified live: fixture 36's content is deliberately, structurally
inconsistent in its quoting (one row uses RFC-4180 doubled-quote escaping,
another contains a lone backslash-quote sequence that is ambiguous between
the doubled-quote and backslash-escape conventions -- exactly the
"convention must be a declared contract parameter, not a detector's guess"
case the fixture itself documents), so a consistency measure failing to
converge on it is the *correct* outcome, not a bug in ``clevercsv``. Calling
``.to_csv_dialect()`` on ``None`` raises ``AttributeError`` rather than
producing a clean decline, so this module treats ``None`` exactly like
Pitfall 1's empty-string case: a declined detection, never a crash and never
a guessed delimiter.
